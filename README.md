I’m Rupinder Rakhra — a cybersecurity professional evolving into DevSecOps engineering, where security meets automation, cloud infrastructure, and agile development. With 15+ years of public service experience and a strong foundation in incident response, threat detection, and SIEM/SOAR platforms, I’m now expanding into the full DevSecOps lifecycle.

Currently preparing for the SC-200 Microsoft Security Operations Analyst certification, I’m deepening my hands-on expertise in infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and secure cloud deployments using tools like Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab, Jenkins, and AWS IAM. My focus is on integrating security seamlessly into agile workflows—bridging the gap between development and operations with a security-first mindset.
